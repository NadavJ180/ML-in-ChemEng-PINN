# Physical Hallucination Detection in PINN-Generated Flow Fields

> **An Undergraduate Research Project in Chemical Engineering**

## 📌 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a compact and reproducible benchmark for detecting **physical hallucinations** in Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-generated two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes flow fields.

A "physical hallucination" is defined as a generated flow field that appears visually plausible but violates governing physical constraints, such as momentum conservation, incompressibility, periodic boundary consistency, or expected energy decay.

## 🔬 Central Research Question
*Can a normalized physics-based score detect visually plausible but physically inconsistent perturbations of PINN-generated 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes flow fields?*

This project does not aim to create a new PINN architecture or a faster CFD solver. Instead, it provides a small, interpretable **detection framework** for identifying physically inconsistent generated flow fields using a Physical Hallucination Score (PHS).

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation
This project is developed and tested on Linux (Ubuntu). To get started, clone the repository and set up a Python virtual environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/nadavj180/ml-in-chemeng-pinn.git](https://github.com/nadavj180/ml-in-chemeng-pinn.git)
cd ml-in-chemeng-pinn

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Running Tests
To verify the physical constraints, residual computations, and point sampling logic, run the test suite using `pytest`:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Visualizing Analytical Solutions
Launch Jupyter to explore the Taylor-Green Vortex generator and verify the initial flow fields:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_tgv_visualization.ipynb
```

## 🎯 Key Deliverables & Roadmap
Based on the project blueprint, the following components are implemented or actively being developed:
- [x] **Taylor-Green Vortex Generator:** Analytical flow generation (`src/physics/taylor_green.py`).
- [x] **Residual Verification:** Navier-Stokes residual computation (`src/physics/navier_stokes.py` & tests).
- [x] **Baseline PINN Architecture:** Configurable neural network (`src/models/pinn.py`).
- [ ] **Baseline PINN Training:** Generating valid PINN flow fields for normalization.
- [ ] **Hallucinated Flow Fields:** Introducing controlled perturbations (spatial, temporal, boundary).
- [ ] **Physical Hallucination Score (PHS):** Implementation and normalization of the detection metric.
- [ ] **Detection Metrics & Baseline Comparison:** Statistical evaluation of the PHS.
